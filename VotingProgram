# Voting Program Task

# Write a function called getVote()

# It should allow one of the following entries: A, B, C or END
# It should validate user input to only allow one of these options or else print an error message and ask for an input again
# It should return the validated response
# TEST your function. Extend your function so that it will accept either upper or lower case data entry (i.e. perform some input sanitization).

# Write a procedure called holdElection()

# You should call the function getVote() and store its result in a variable.
# You should update the variables values for (e.g.) aTot, bTot, cTot according to how a vote was cast (i.e. Candidate A, B or C).
# This should continue until getVote() has returned END.
# Return the candidatesâ€™ totals in a list (assume A, then B, then C)  
# TEST your procedure.
# Write a procedure called presentResults(votesList)

# This procedure should assume VotesList has 3 values for A, B and C 
# It should print out suitable messages for:
# The total each candidate a,b and c scored
# The total number of votes cast
# TEST your procedure e.g. call it with presentResults([10,5,3]) and check the output.

# Finally, write the main program.  This should just call holdElection() and then call presentResults(votes) with the result of the holdElection() call.

# String tasks 

# For a given string, write a function countC(s) which takes a string, in this case called s, and returns the number of times the capital letter C appears in it. E.g. 
# print(countC("This list has only one capital C in it")) should print out the answer 1. 
# print(countC("But this has all lower case cs in it, no capitals")) should print out 0 (there are several instances of lower case c, though.) 
# Generalise your answer to question 1, count(s, c) which takes a string and a character and returns the number of time that character appears
# print(count("Hello World", 'l')) should print 3.  
# Write a function, sumthedigits(i) that takes an integer and returns the sum of its digits.  
# print(sumthedigits(12345)) should print 15   
# print(sumthedigits(234545)) should print 23 

# String/List functions 

# In the example code above you can see how to change a string into a list of characters, write a function list_to_string(listOfCharacters) which takes a list of characters and returns them all joined together to make a string. 
# E.g. print(list_to_string(['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd'])) should print out, hello world. 
# For a given list, write a function to return a new list in reverse order of the original - reverse(x) 
# print(reverse([5,4,1,2,True)) should print [True, 2, 1, 4, 5]
# Can you create a function (perhaps using your function from questions 3 and 4) called reverse_string(original) that will return a string that is the reverse of the original. 
# print(reverse_string("hello")) should print olleh
# For a given list of numbers write a function even_numbers(x) which will return a new list of only the even numbers (if the item is not a number, ignore it and donâ€™t print anything) 
# For a given string write a function every_other_character(st, b) which takes a boolean and will return a new string made of only the even numbered locations if the boolean is true, otherwise all the odd numbered locations.
